In pursuit of my dreams, I have mastered the art of leading a store, but my true passion lies in the world of software engineering. With a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's in Software Engineering, I am now ready to embark on an exciting new chapter in my career.

My journey has equipped me with diverse skills in MySQL, SQL, Dart, Flutter, Python, C++, and more. I have also delved into the realms of Firebase, Git, and machine learning, always seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise.

As a software engineer, I envision crafting elegant solutions and building cutting-edge applications that leave a lasting impact. I am eager to collaborate, innovate, and grow alongside a team of like-minded professionals, creating technology that drives positive change in the world.

With a relentless drive to learn, adapt, and overcome challenges, I am confident that my determination and dedication will make me a valuable asset to any organization. I am excited to bridge the gap from my store lead experience to software engineering, bringing my leadership skills to drive success in every project.

If you seek a passionate software engineer committed to excellence and eager to make a difference, I am ready to take on new challenges and embrace opportunities that align with my vision. Let's connect and work together to shape a brighter future.
